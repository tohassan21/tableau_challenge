As instructed by our instructor Thomas Bogue, I included my analysis on the dashboard and story pages of my Tableau workbook.

In this folder are the data files that I used. 
This includes the data for June, July, and August 2024.
My discoveries are limited to and may only apply to the Summer of 2024 because of the data I used.
